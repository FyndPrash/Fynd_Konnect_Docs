**What is Shopify?**
Shopify is a commerce platform that allows anyone to set up an online store and sell their products. Merchants can also sell their products in person with Shopify POS.
* A Shopify app extends the existing functionality of Shopify. Most Shopify apps are built by third-party developers, not by Shopify.
* You can build an app to add features to Shopify stores and extend the Shopify admin experience, or to create unique buying experiences for customers. You can also pull Shopify store data into your app, platform, or integration.
* To tailor experiences to their specific needs, users install Shopify apps to help build their business, integrate with external services, and add features to their Shopify admin.
